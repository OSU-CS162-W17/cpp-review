C++ Review Examples
===================

This repo contains some example code to review C++ stuff from CS 161 (specifically pointers, arrays, and structs).  To see the code in action, it can be compiled and run like this:
```
g++ pointers.cpp -o pointers
./pointers

g++ structs.cpp -o structs
./structs
```
